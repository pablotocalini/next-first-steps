# *__Next.js Project__* - First Practice Project

Welcome to my Next.js project repository! This repository contains the codebase for an example project built with Next.js bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). Throughout the development process, I explored various features of Next.js, leveraging its capabilities to create modern and efficient web applications.

## *Features:*
- **Server-side Rendering (SSR):** Utilized Next.js SSR capabilities to render pages on the server, improving performance and SEO.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Leveraged Next.js SSG to generate static HTML pages at build time, enabling fast loading and caching.
- **API Routes:** Implemented API routes to handle server-side logic and data fetching, keeping the codebase clean and organized.
- **Dynamic Routing:** Utilized Next.js dynamic routing to create dynamic and personalized user experiences.
- **Styling:** Styled components using CSS modules and Tailwind CSS to create beautiful and responsive UI designs.
- **Optimized Performance:** Ensured optimal performance with Next.js optimizations such as code splitting, image optimization, and lazy loading.

## Technologies Used:
- Next.js 12.0
- React 18.0
- Tailwind CSS
- CSS Modules
  
## How to Run:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
